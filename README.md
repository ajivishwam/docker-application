      First go into `/work/` folder in browser and then upload
    ```
7. Run the Python notebooks.

8. Execute the `docker` script when done, to remove the container from desktop

You can try the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
docker restart my_postgresql
docker stop my_postgresql
docker rm my_postgresql
docker volume ls
docker volume rm DAP2023-project_postgresql_data
docker-compose up -d

docker restart my_mongodb
docker stop my_mongodb
docker rm my_mongodb
docker volume ls
docker volume rm DAP2023-project_mongodb_data
docker-compose up -d
```
